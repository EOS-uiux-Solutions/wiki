## Semantic-Releases

Master will always hold the latest and most updated version of our application, although unstable and not ready to be published internally, while stable releases will be tagged and published by mentors of the EOS Icons Adobe Xd Extension Project.

A tag can be created before all items in the roadmap are done if the PO suggests there is an important patch or feature our consumers would benefit from having.

We will follow the Semantic Versioning (http://semver.org/) as follows below:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes, changes in MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner, and PATCH version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes. Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version.

## Updating a Plugin

Currently there are no CI/CD's available for this plugin. We have to manually update the plugin everytime we make substantial changes to the code.
To update the plugin, the process is as follows:
1. Make changes to the code.
2. Check everything is working correctly.
3. Package the plugin into ".xdx" format using Adobe UXP Developer Tool.
4. Vist https://developer.adobe.com and click on Console.
5. Sign in with our organization's Adobe account. Reach out the mentors or organziation admin regarding credentials.
6. Go to Projects and click on "EOS Icons for XD".
7. Click on Adobe Xd to view the plugin, status and version.
8. Click on "Add New Version".
9. Add "Release Notes" and update the Plugin File with the updated file.
10. After that Adobe's team will review the plugin changes and approve it. Also, they can ask for any modifications if needed.

Following these steps the plugin will be updated and a newer version will be available in the Adobe Creative Cloud Marketplace.
